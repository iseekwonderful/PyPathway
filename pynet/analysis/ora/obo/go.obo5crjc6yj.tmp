comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

def: "An intracellular protein kinase cascade containing at least a MAPK, a MAPKK and a MAP3K. The cascade can also contain two additional tiers: the upstream MAP4K and the downstream MAP Kinase-activated kinase (MAPKAPK). The kinases in each tier phosphorylate and activate the kinases in the downstream tier to transmit a signal within a cell." [GOC:bf, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11, PMID:20811974, PMID:9561267]
comment: MAPK cascades lie downstream of many cell surface receptors and cooperate in transmitting various extracellular signals to the nucleus. One way by which the specificity of each cascade is regulated is through the existence of several distinct components in each tier of the different cascades. The cascades are typically named according to the component in the MAPK tier.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that although the many U12-type introns have the sequence AT-AC at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U2-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron.

def: "The process whose specific outcome is the progression of a fruiting body organ over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The fruiting body is a spore bearing structure. In fungi, the sporocarp (also known as fruiting body) is a multicellular structure on which spore-producing structures, such as basidia or asci, are borne. The fruiting body is part of the sexual phase of a fungal life cycle, with the rest of the life cycle being characterized by vegetative mycelial growth. The sporocarp of a basidiomycete is known as a basidiocarp, while the fruiting body of an ascomycete is known as an ascocarp. A significant range of different shapes and morphologies is found in both basidiocarps and ascocarps; these features play an important role in the identification and taxonomy of fungi."

There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription.

ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

comment: The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription.

comment: The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if an organism were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the organism is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.

comment: Transcription termination sites can be recognized by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) itself or by another protein which interacts with the RNAP to promote transcription termination. Note that not all genes have a specific sequence that functions as a termination site; for most mRNAs transcribed by RNAP II termination is not mediated by a specific termination sequence, but is coupled to polyadenylation.

In contrast, in bacteria such as E. coli, the phrase "upstream activating sequence", or UAS is a synonym for "enhancer".

def: "Cell motility due to movement of eukaryotic cilia or bacterial-type flagella or archaeal-type flagella." [GOC:cilia, GOC:hjd, GOC:krc]
comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.

Any event that induces apoptosis will at some point induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

comment: Note that podosomes can be distinguished from other F-actin-rich structures or from other matrix contacts. For example, focal adhesions and focal contacts do not display a core structure of F-actin. Unlike focal adhesions, podosome assembly does not require de novo protein synthesis. However, most of the podosome ring components are found in focal adhesions and other cell-matrix contacts. Podosomes are typically found in cells that cross tissue boundaries, recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells, and are often sites of extracellular matrix degradation.

Nematode larval development begins with the newly hatched first-stage larva (L1) and ends with the end of the last larval stage (for example the fourth larval stage (L4) in C. elegans). Each stage of nematode larval development is characterized by proliferation of specific cell lineages and an increase in body size without alteration of the basic body plan. Nematode larval stages are separated by molts in which each stage-specific exoskeleton, or cuticle, is shed and replaced anew." [GOC:ems, GOC:kmv]

comment: In E. coli, the first step of the reaction is reductive elimination of sulfur from L-cysteine by IscS cysteine desulfurase to form an enzyme-bound cysteine-persulfide intermediate. Then, five essential gene products, TusA, TusB, TusC, TusD and TusE, mediate a sulfur relay that delivers the terminal sulfur of persulfide from IscS to MnmA12. The last protein, MnmA catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur from IscS to an ATP activated U34 of the tRNA.

Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory).

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.

comment: This term was obsoleted because "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription vs "specific" transcription were determined not to be separable, distinct process. Thus, terms trying to distinguish "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription from "specific" transcription were removed from both the Molecular Function and the Biological Process ontologies.

comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.

def: "OBSOLETE. Catalysis of the reaction: (5-L-glutamyl)-peptide + an amino acid = peptide + 5-L-glutamyl-amino acid." [EC:2.3.2.2]
comment: This term was obsoleted because it does not correspond to a physiological reaction.\nUsage comment: The gene family commonly referred to as gamma-glutamyl transferases (GGT) catalyze hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl bonds in gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione. In a test tube one can set up conditions in which the enzyme will transfer the gamma-glutamyl portion of the substrate to an acceptor molecule, but this requires non-physiologic conditions, including millmolar concentrations of an acceptor such as glygly. This reaction is used in assays to detect the presence of the enzyme, but is not a physiological function of members of the GGT family (PMC4388159), which should be annotated to a suitable hydrolysis term instead (e.g. glutathione hydrolase activity).

def: "Catalysis of the reaction: citrate = isocitrate. The reaction occurs in two steps: (1) citrate = cis-aconitate + H2O, (2) cis-aconitate + H2O = isocitrate. This reaction is the interconversion of citrate and isocitrate via the labile, enzyme-bound intermediate cis-aconitate. Water is removed from one part of the citrate molecule and added back to a different atom to form isocitrate." [EC:4.2.1.3, GOC:pde, GOC:vw]
comment: This is a process composed of two reactions represented by the terms 'GO:0052632 : citrate hydro-lyase (cis-aconitate-forming) activity' and 'GO:0052633 : isocitrate hydro-lyase (cis-aconitate-forming) activity'.
